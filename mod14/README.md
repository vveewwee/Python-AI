# Natural Language Processing (NLP) using spaCy

## Natural Language 🗣️

Natural language refers to the way we, humans, communicate with each other.
Namely, speech and text.
We are surrounded by text.

Think about how much text you see each day:

    Signs
    Menus
    Email
    SMS
    Web Pages
    and so much more…

Given the importance of this type of data, we must have methods to understand and reason about natural language, just like we do for other types of data.

## Natural-Language-processing ✏️

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them.

The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
